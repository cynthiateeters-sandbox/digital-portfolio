      <p>Here, I've uploaded the work I'm most proud of in my skills, whether that would
      be web design, visual design, traditional design, and much more. There are plenty of projects I've
      uploaded so I hope you're able to enjoy them!</p>
      <p>Below is some of my favorite work that I'm fond of immensely, or you can go to the blog page to see my most recent posts.</p>
