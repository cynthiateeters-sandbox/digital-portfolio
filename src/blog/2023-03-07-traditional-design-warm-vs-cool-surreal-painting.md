### D﻿escription of Painting - 

T﻿his is a painting that I did in my Color Theory course where one of the weekly assignments was a painting focusing on Warm vs Colors and Surrealism at the same time. These topics were also topics that were gone over in class to get a better understanding of how to have depicted them in our paintings that we did individually.
