### D﻿escription of Website - Style Stage: Shimmering Stars

T﻿his is my theme of the Style Stage challenge that's made by Stephanie Eckles, a web developer. The challenge for this was it was to customize the Style Stage purely through Sass CSS without touching anything in regards to the already-made HTML that served to help customize the stage.
