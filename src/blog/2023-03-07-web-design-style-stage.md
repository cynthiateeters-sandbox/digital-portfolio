### D﻿escription of Website - Style Stage: Shimmering Stars

T﻿his is my theme of the Style Stage challenge that was made by Stephanie Eckles, a web developer, where she has a website that explains the challenge in more detail. The challenge for this was it was to customize the Style Stage purely through Sass CSS without touching anything in regards to the already-made HTML that served to help customize the stage.
