### D﻿escription of Website - Simple Poem Website

T﻿his is an image of the layout for a poem website that I made at the beginning portion of my Web Development II class to practice HTML and CSS again. This sample poem website includes a separation between stanzas to emphasize how the text presented is of a poem by a famous poet and an image to give a sense of what the poem is truly about.
