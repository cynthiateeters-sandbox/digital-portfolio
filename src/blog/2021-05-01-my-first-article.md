### Dï»¿escription of Club Poster

These are one of two posters that I designed for RVCC's Society of Women Engineers Club, where its theme was promoting how the club was awarded for being Club of the Month in December 2022 at the Student Government Association General Assembly Meeting. I wanted to make the poster look presentable and professional, but also have a hint of playfulness to it so I chose a color scheme that would be both calm and vibrant to the targeted audience, which in this case, would be students who come across looking at the poster.
