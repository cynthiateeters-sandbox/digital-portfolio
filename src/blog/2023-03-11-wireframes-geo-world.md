### D﻿escription of Wireframes - Geo World

T﻿hese wireframes are a part of the 3-step process for the Midterm project that occurred in my Interface Design & Human Computer Interaction class, where the wireframes were the third part of it to provide visual context of an app me and a partner designed for a particular topic and users. Our topic was to focus on museums and how a large-scale museum can offer transportation for its visitors if they want to visit other buildings that are remotely too far to walk, similarly to the Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C. for example.
